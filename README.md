  # Overview
  
  The Employee Search Tool is a demonstration that illustrates how easily leaked sensitive employee information can be misused. The 2023 Amazon employee database breach exposed the contact details of 1.1 million employees, which are ~~still active~~ and easily accessible online thorugh various forums. This creates a high risk for social engineering attacks as demonstrated through the Twitter hack of 2020.
  The 2023 Amazon employee database breach exposed the contact details of 1.2 million employees, including phone numbers and emails. I validated the phone numbers of these employees including VPs and principal engineers, still had active phone numbers as of March 2025. Given this, it's highly likely that their emails are still active as well. This data remains easily accessible online through various forums, creating a significant risk for social engineering attacks—similar to the Twitter hack of 2020.
